2. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that you haven't implemented this feature.
- Describe how you store a VarChar field.

NullValuesIndicator|FieldOffsets|Length|VarChar|Unsigned|Real

FieldOffsets - offset1|offset2|…offsetN
Offset - short, points to the end of field

For VarChar, a unsigned indicating the length is set ahead of the field

3. Page Format
- Show your page format design

Record1|Record2|…|RecordN|———Empty Space———|RecordOffsetN|…|RecordOffset2|RecordOffset1|NumberOfEmptyBytes|NumberOfRecord

RecordOffset - short, points to the end of a record
NumberOfEmptyBytes - short
NumberOfRecord - short

4. Implementation Detail
- Other implementation details goes here.

When inserting, fieldOffsets table is generated from input and stored between NullValuesIndicator and the actual field data in a page of a file. When reading a record, fieldOffsets table is eliminated and then printed. So the fieldOffsets table is invisible to user.

5. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 1, but not related to the other sections (optional)
